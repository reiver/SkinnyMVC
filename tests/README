The Unit Tests use SimpleTest as their framework.  The files for it are contained in the "simpletest/" directory.

Use the Helper Library in "SkinnyMvcTest.php" to help you test SkinnyMVC.

Note that the "SkinnyMvcTest.php" Helper Library has a Unit Test for it!!!!  (It's obviously an important one.)
Namely, it's "TestSkinnyMvcTest.php".
