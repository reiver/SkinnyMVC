SkinnyMVC README
================

This is the build system for SkinnyMVC.

When developers get SkinnyMVC, they receive it as one PHP file: "skinnymvc.php". That one file is created by this build system.



BUILDING
========

Building the "skinnymvc.php" is done with the following command:

    php build.php > skinnymvc.php



DEVELOPING
==========

What's in the "src-level-0" directory should be replaced when you upgrade.  And of course added when you install.

What's in the "src-level-1" directory should NOT be replace when you upgrade.  But only added when you install.
